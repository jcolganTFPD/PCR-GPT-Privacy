    <h1>Privacy Policy for PCR and Incident Report Assistant</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 01/06/2025</p>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 01/06/2025</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled when you interact with this service.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Information You Provide</h2>
    <p>The information you input while using this GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is processed by OpenAI to generate responses. Examples of input data include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Text-based descriptions for patient care reports (PCRs) or incident reports.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>2. Data Handling</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Data Collection by Us:</strong> We do not collect, store, or retain any data you input. All interactions occur in real-time and are managed by OpenAI.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Processing:</strong> Input data is temporarily processed by OpenAI to generate responses but is not retained or stored permanently by the GPT itself.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>3. OpenAI’s Role in Data Processing</h2>
    <p>OpenAI, as the platform provider, may process and store data in accordance with its Privacy Policy. OpenAI adheres to industry-standard security measures to protect your data during processing.</p>
    
    <h2>4. HIPAA Compliance</h2>
    <p>For users entering Protected Health Information (PHI) as part of patient care reports, it is your responsibility to ensure compliance with HIPAA and other relevant regulations. OpenAI does not provide guarantees regarding HIPAA compliance, and this GPT is designed to minimize unnecessary data exposure.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Your Responsibilities</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>While sensitive or personally identifiable information (PII) may be necessary for generating a PCR, you are responsible for avoiding the inclusion of such data in incident reports, as outlined in the GPT's guidelines.</li>
        <li>The GPT is designed to minimize and remove such data but cannot guarantee complete removal. Review all generated content for accuracy and confidentiality before using it in any official capacity.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>This service is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 18. No data is knowingly processed from children.</p>
    
    <h2>7. Updates to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may revise this policy from time to time. The most current version will be accessible via the link provided with this GPT.</p>
    
    <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>For any questions or concerns regarding this GPT or its privacy practices, please contact OpenAI directly through their support page.</p>
